#Resume template written in Latex

This is a handy dandy template following the setup that I use for my own resumes.

##Usage

Linux:

```bash
		git clone https://github.com/ajsnapshots/latex-resume-template.git resume
		cd resume
		pdflatex resume.tex
```

##Organization

* `resume.tex` is a fully commented skeleton template intended to provide an easy starting point for edits.
* `resume_bertrand_russell.tex` is a small tribute/fully fleshed out sample to give you an idea of the final product.
